Working repository for the unnamed "bt" project.

Multi stage supply lines like **Factorio** and **Settlers**.
"Hard to achieve balance" between resources, waste products, power, transportation of resources, etc similar to **Oxygen not Included**

Ability to create country-scale production lines with thounsands of units delivering resources in different ways between mines, factories, processing plants, etc.

Totally OK to have a chain of production that creates small/medium amounts of infinite resources as long as it comsumes significant amounts power.
